Hi, I'm a master student at New York University. Currently, I work with [Prof. Marcelo Mattar](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/marcelo-mattar.html) on developing Meta RL agent with capability to efficiently sample from memory and make flexible decision. Additionally, I work with [Prof. Paul Glimcher](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/paul-glimcher.html) on a project where we are trying to understanding the relationship between reference point and distributional RL using neural data. Prior to this, I graduated with an B.S. in Psychology from [School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences](https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/)in July 2024, where I worked with [Prof. Jian Li](https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/professor/jianli/index.htm). My undergraduate thesis investigated the context-dependent exploration-exploitation behavior on human decision making.

My research interest lies in using the architecture of reinforcement learning theory to understand neural and computational mechanism of human adaptive behavior and decision-making. Humanâ€™s decision can be shaped and biased by their preceding experience due to limited memory capacity and restrained computational resources. However, human also exhibits superior learning and generalization ability with just a few experience. From the perspective of efficient coding, there must be some potential mechanism and advantages for human as an organism to own this capacity compared to AI. Thus, I try to reveal the neural and computational mechanism of human flexible decision making and learning process by combining the architecture of reinforcement learning and other mathematical approaches.
