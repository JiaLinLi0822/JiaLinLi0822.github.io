Hi, I'm a master student at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu). Currently, I work with [Prof. Marcelo Mattar](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/marcelo-mattar.html) on developing Meta RL agent with capability to efficiently sample from memory and make flexible decision. Additionally, I work with [Prof. Paul Glimcher](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/paul-glimcher.html) on a project where we are trying to understanding the relationship between reference point and distributional RL using neural data. Prior to this, I graduated with an B.S. in Psychology from [School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences](https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in July 2024, where I worked with [Prof. Jian Li](https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/professor/jianli/index.htm). My undergraduate thesis investigated the context-dependent exploration-exploitation behavior on human decision making.

My research interest lies in understanding the neural and computational mechanism of human adaptive behavior and decision-making. Humanâ€™s decision can be understood as in a 'resource-rational' way, where we are trying to maximize our utility under the limited memory and computational capacity. From the perspective of efficient coding, human must leverage the limited cognitive resources to form efficient internal representation, enabling adaptation to changing environments. That is also the key point in terms of why human exhibits superior learning and generalization ability in different scenarios. Therefore, I try to reveal the potential neural and computational mechanism of human flexible decision-making. Specifically, I seek to understand what kinds of internal representations are essential for adaptive decision processes by integrating concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory.

My research skills include:
- **Coding**: Python (Proficient), R (Proficient), MATLAB (Proficient), LaTeX (Proficient), Julia (Elementary), JavaScript/CSS/HTML (Intermediate)
- **Data Collection**: Behavior (Psychtoolbox/Psychpy/jsPsych), Eye-tracking (EyeLink), EEG (BrainVision)
- **Computational**: Reinforcement learning (Gym), Hierarchy Bayesian Inference (Pymc), Artificial Neural Network (Pytorch, Tensorflow)
- **Command line**: Git, Bash, Vim
